'Initial length' must be a fraction between 0 and 1; this is proportional to the height of the canvas

For animation, 'thing' refers to the characteristic being animated (0 for init length, 1 for length scaling, so on).
'Animation delay' is the delay in milliseconds between frames. Recommended: 50 for 20 FPS
Oh, also, while 'angle' is in degrees, the min and max value for angle animations have to be in radians.
